## üí° Usage

Interacting with the Brain AI Chatbot is designed to be intuitive and engaging. Here's how you can use it:

1.  **Start a New Chat**: Upon launching the application, a "New Chat" session is automatically created if no previous sessions exist. You can also click the `New Chat` button (plus icon) in the sidebar to begin a fresh conversation at any time.
2.  **Type Your Query**: Use the input box at the bottom of the screen to type your questions, prompts, or messages to the AI. The input field intelligently saves your draft, so you won't lose your thoughts if you navigate away.
3.  **Send Message**: Press the `Enter` key or click the `Send` (arrow-up) icon to submit your query.
4.  **Observe AI Response**: The AI's response will appear in the chat area above the input box, complete with a subtle typing animation to indicate activity.
5.  **Regenerate Response**: If the AI's last answer wasn't quite what you were looking for, simply click the `Regenerate` (rotate icon) button located below the last AI message. The AI will generate an alternative response based on the preceding conversation.
6.  **Copy Messages**: You can easily copy any message (both your queries and the AI's responses) to your clipboard by clicking the `Copy` icon next to the message.
7.  **Manage Sessions**:
    - **Switch Sessions**: All your conversations are saved. Access previous chats by selecting them from the sidebar. Each session is titled dynamically based on your first query.
    - **Delete Sessions**: Hover over a chat session in the sidebar and click the `Trash` (bin icon) to permanently remove it.
8.  **Toggle Theme**: Switch between `Dark Mode` and `Light Mode` using the theme toggle button located at the bottom of the sidebar. This allows you to personalize your viewing experience.
9.  **Responsive Sidebar**: The sidebar is responsive, automatically adjusting its display for mobile devices, ensuring a consistent experience across various screen sizes.
